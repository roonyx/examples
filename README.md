## Javascript

**JavaScript** is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on 
web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information 
for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, 
scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

## Ruby on Rails
    
**Ruby on Rails**, or **Rails**, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under
the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures 
for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards 
such as JSON or XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for display and user interfacing. 
In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns 
and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and 
the active record pattern.
